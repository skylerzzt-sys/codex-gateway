# CPA Account Config Manager

[涓枃鏂囨。](README.md)

`cpa-account-config-manager` is a native
[CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) plugin for managing
CPA accounts from one authenticated workspace. It adds account CRUD, batch
operations, import/export conversion, quota visibility, model tests, plugin
updates, and an operation journal without exposing raw credentials to the browser.

## Highlights

- List, search, filter, view, add, edit, enable, disable, deduplicate, and
  delete accounts. Page sizes include 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000.
- Run selected or filtered batch edits with a server-side preview, revision
  checks, bounded workers, per-account results, and failed-only retry.
- Display CPA request counters, token totals, Codex 5-hour and 7-day quota
  windows, plan type, and active reset count when CPA or the upstream account
  provides that data.
- Test provider models through CPA for Codex/OpenAI, Claude, Gemini/AI Studio,
  and xAI. Account allow-lists and deny-lists are respected by manual tests.
- Keep a persistent, redacted operation journal. Disable and enable entries
  include the actual normalized reason, such as quota exhaustion, invalid
  credentials, quota reset, health recovery, or credential refresh.
- Detect plugin updates through the CPA Plugin Store and display the current
  and latest CPA server versions. CPA executable updates remain read-only
  version guidance; the plugin never replaces the CPA binary.
- Read Codex plan and active-reset metadata and, after explicit confirmation,
  consume one available reset credit and refresh the account quota.
- Experimentally support Codex 5-hour and 7-day quota overdraft continuation plus Agent
  Identity and personal access token import, login, and native plugin auth.
- Follow the CPA Management Center language and theme. The UI supports English,
  Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Russian.

## Account Transfer

Import accepts pasted JSON text or up to 10,000 accounts from mixed JSON,
JSON Lines, text, and ZIP files. A ZIP may contain multiple supported files.
Every import is previewed, bounded, duplicate-checked, and written in a
cancellable background job only through
CPA Auth callbacks; existing Auth files are not overwritten.

Supported inputs include native CPA files, common sub2api account collections,
Codex OAuth/PAT and Agent Identity variants, Claude, Gemini, and other formats
that can be converted into a CPA-supported Auth document. The recursive
importer also recognizes common account JSON structures emitted by Cockpit,
9router, AxonHub, and Codex Manager. Agent Identity conversion remains opt-in
under Experimental Features because it depends on upstream authentication
behavior.

Exports can target CPA, sub2api, Cockpit, 9router, Codex, AxonHub, and Codex
Manager formats. Formats that cannot represent multiple accounts as one file
are downloaded as a ZIP containing separate account files. Operational reports
are available as JSON, CSV, or JSON Lines and never contain credentials.

## Installation

Installing from the CPA Plugin Store is recommended because CPA selects the
platform archive, verifies checksums, and reports whether a host restart is
required. Manual release archives are also available for:

| Platform | Architecture | Library |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | amd64 | `.so` |
| Linux | arm64 | `.so` |
| macOS | arm64 | `.dylib` |
| Windows | amd64 | `.dll` |

For a manual installation, verify the matching `.sha256` file, extract the
library into CPA's platform plugin directory, and enable it in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  dir: plugins
  configs:
    cpa-account-config-manager:
      enabled: true
      priority: 20
```

After CPA loads the plugin, open **CPA-A Manager** in the Management Center.
Most CPA plugin-store updates need only a page refresh; restart CPA only when
the host reports `restart_required: true` or the loaded library is locked.

## Configuration And Persistence

The UI persists supported settings back to CPA's plugin configuration. These
optional plugin fields remain available for deployment-level configuration:

| Field | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workers` | `6` | Concurrent account mutations, clamped to 1-16. |
| `data_dir` | `data/cpa-account-config-manager` | Private state for usage, updates, runtime ownership, jobs, and logs. |
| `management_base_url` | `http://127.0.0.1:8317` | Loopback CPA Management API base for authenticated operations. |

Persist `data_dir` when CPA runs in a replaceable container. If no explicit
data directory is configured, the plugin can mirror sanitized usage state
under a common local Auth directory, but an explicit persistent mount is more
predictable. The CPA process needs read/write access to the Auth directory and
the effective plugin data directory.

Experimental Features currently contains:

- Codex 5-hour and 7-day quota overdraft probing, which relies on upstream tool-call
  continuation behavior.
- Codex Agent Identity/PAT conversion and authentication hooks.

Both are off by default and isolated behind stable hooks so they can be removed
without changing the standard account-management paths.

## Security Model

- All privileged endpoints are fixed, authenticated CPA Management routes.
- The public resource route serves only the embedded static UI.
- Management keys remain in the current browser/CPA request path and are never
  persisted by the plugin.
- Raw Auth JSON, tokens, cookies, proxy credentials, header values, and raw
  upstream responses are excluded from public models, logs, and saved state.
- Imports and exports are count- and size-bounded. ZIP entries are validated
  against path traversal and archive expansion limits.
- Account mutations use previews, physical revisions, a shared writer lock,
  and conflict checks. Destructive actions require explicit confirmation.
- Private directories and files use restrictive permissions where supported.

## Compatibility

The plugin uses CLIProxyAPI native plugin ABI/schema version 1 and requires a
CPA build with native plugin discovery, Auth list/get/save callbacks, the Usage
Plugin callback, and current authenticated Management APIs for Auth status,
field edits, account-selected API calls, deletion, and plugin-store updates.
It does not import CLIProxyAPI Go packages and does not patch the CPA binary.

## Development

Prerequisites: Go 1.24+, Node.js 20+, npm, `make`, and a C toolchain suitable
for CGO.

```bash
make verify
make build
make package VERSION=X.Y.Z
```

`make verify` formats and tests Go code, tests and builds the React UI, checks
embedded assets, and validates release metadata. Release tags are annotated as
`vX.Y.Z`; the release workflow builds four platform archives, four matching
`.sha256` files, and `checksums.txt`.
