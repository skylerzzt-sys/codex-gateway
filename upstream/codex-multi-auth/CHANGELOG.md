# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
Dates use ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

This repository's current stable release line is `2.x`. Full release notes live in [`docs/releases/`](docs/releases/) — this file is the short version. Pre-`0.1.0` iteration history is archived in [`docs/releases/legacy-pre-0.1-history.md`](docs/releases/legacy-pre-0.1-history.md).

## [2.8.6] - 2026-08-16

`forecast --model` reported an account `ready` while every request to it failed, and the pinned-account 503 told forced pins to run a command that clears nothing. [Full notes](docs/releases/v2.8.6.md).

### Fixed

- `forecast`, `best`, and `report` with `--model` check that model's prompt family instead of a hardwired `codex` family. An account held down by a live limit for the family you asked about no longer reports `ready` with no reasons ([#670](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/670))
- Those commands no longer report a delay caused by a rate limit on a *different* model in the same family — availability now uses exactly the two keys account selection consults ([#670](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/670))
- When a family-wide and a model-specific limit are both active, the reported wait is the later one rather than the earlier, so the stated time is actually usable ([#670](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/670))
- A recorded `rate-limited` state backed by a live limit for the requested family is no longer discarded as stale ([#670](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/670))
- The pinned-account 503 no longer advises `unpin` for a pin set by `--account` / `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_ACCOUNT`, which `unpin` cannot clear. Forced pins are told to relaunch ([#671](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/671))
- That 503 now reports when the account recovers, taking the latest of its rate limit, cooldown, and circuit-breaker deadline ([#671](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/671))
- A permanently blocked pin — disabled, no enabled workspace, invalidated token, policy block — reports no recovery time instead of a deadline that expires into another 503 ([#671](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/671))
- That suppression now also holds when the request itself is what disabled the account, which previously surfaced as `already-attempted` and hid the block ([#671](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/671))
- A corrupt timestamp in stored account state no longer turns the pinned 503 into a generic 500 carrying no account index, reason, or skip map ([#671](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/671))

### Added

- `pin_source`, `reset_at`, and `retry_after_ms` on `codex_pinned_account_unavailable` responses ([#671](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/671))

### Changed

- `docs/reference/error-contracts.md` documents the new fields, both pin kinds, and how `retry_after_ms` differs between the pinned and pool-exhausted codes ([#671](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/671))

## [2.8.5] - 2026-08-13

Background rotation helpers never shut down — 183 of them at 5.58 GB on one machine, the oldest 33 hours past a 12-hour timeout. [Full notes](docs/releases/v2.8.5.md).

### Fixed

- Helpers no longer treat a reused process ID as a live launcher. Owner identity is now process ID plus start time ([#663](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/663), [#664](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/664))
- Each helper writes its own status file instead of all of them overwriting one, so `rotation status` no longer reports a random helper ([#663](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/663), [#664](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/664))
- Helper metadata is cleaned up on exit and swept on the next launch, instead of accumulating forever — 701 leftover files on one machine ([#663](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/663), [#664](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/664))
- Helpers left behind by a short-lived command are reaped in 15 minutes rather than 12 hours ([#665](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/665))
- That reaper no longer kills a live `codex app` session that is simply idle between messages ([#669](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/669))
- `rotation unbind-app` no longer strands owner files it can't pair with a status record ([#666](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/666), [#669](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/669))
- `rotation status` can no longer name one helper on its status line while marking a different helper's account as current ([#667](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/667), [#669](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/669))
- A stale status file with a reused process ID no longer counts as a running helper ([#667](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/667), [#669](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/669))
- Malformed process IDs in status files are rejected instead of being probed ([#667](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/667), [#669](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/669))

### Added

- `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_MAX_LIFETIME_MS` — hard cap on helper lifetime, default 24h, `0` disables ([#664](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/664))
- `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_DETACHED_IDLE_MS` — shorter timeout for a helper whose launcher died and that never served a request, default 15m, `0` keeps the full idle timeout ([#665](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/665), [#669](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/669))

### Changed

- Helper status files are now per-process: `runtime-rotation-app-helper.<pid>.json`. The old shared path is still read but no longer written ([#664](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/664))
- The stale-metadata sweep runs after the helper spawns, so it no longer delays `codex app` or TUI startup ([#669](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/669))
- `rotation unbind-app` stops helpers in parallel instead of one at a time ([#669](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/669))

### Security

- Removed the deprecated `@openauthjs/openauth` dependency. PKCE is now generated directly from `node:crypto` per RFC 7636 ([#661](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/661))
- Test-only failure hooks in the published wrapper now require an explicit opt-in, so a stray environment variable can't arm one ([#668](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/668), [#669](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/669))

## [2.8.4] - 2026-08-12

`codex app-server` didn't work at all with rotation on, which is the default. [Full notes](docs/releases/v2.8.4.md).

### Fixed

- `app-server` refused to start on any machine that had run one before, and served a frozen thread list when it did start. It now uses your real Codex home rather than a mirrored copy ([#659](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/659), [#662](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/662))
- The CLI shim `app-server` didn't need was setting `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_RUNTIME_ROTATION_PROXY=0` on everything the server spawned, so nested commands ran unrotated and billed the wrong account ([#662](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/662))
- A short-lived `app-server` left a helper process running for 12 hours after exit ([#662](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/662))
- A helper that couldn't start surfaced as an unhandled-rejection stack trace, leaking a temporary directory. It's now a one-line error and exit 1 ([#662](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/662))

### Changed

- A rotation proxy that can't start now fails `app-server` outright rather than silently running it unrotated — a wrong-account bill is invisible, a failed start isn't ([#662](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/662))

## [2.8.3] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- Quota windows with no label, duration, or reset time are hidden instead of rendering as a permanent `100%` ([#657](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/657))

## [2.8.2] - 2026-08-09

Five fixes across login, uninstall, diagnostics, and quota. [Full notes](docs/releases/v2.8.2.md).

### Fixed

- Manual and incognito login now show the complete authorization URL, so pasting the callback back no longer fails with a state-mismatch error ([#652](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/652))
- Uninstall instructions pointed at the old scoped package name, which can't remove what's installed ([#653](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/653))
- `why-selected` showed a winning account the rotation proxy would never have picked. It now runs the same gates as the real thing ([#654](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/654))
- Accounts with a revoked token are marked `token-invalid — re-login needed` and stay out of rotation instead of rejoining after a cooldown ([#655](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/655))
- Exhausted weekly and monthly quotas wait for the real reset instead of retrying after a flat two hours and hitting an immediate `429` ([#656](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/656))
- Rotation helpers verify they own a process before shutting it down, so an unrelated process is never mistaken for one of ours ([#658](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/658))

## [2.8.1] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- `mcodex resume` and `fork` hung on a blank screen. They were using a temporary copy of your Codex home that deliberately omits the session database, so the thread you asked for genuinely wasn't there ([#647](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/647), [#648](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/648))
- The shell prompt didn't always come back after an interrupted Codex exit ([#648](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/648))
- `--help` no longer starts a rotation proxy and leaves a background helper behind ([#648](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/648))

### Security

- `hono` 4.12.21 → 4.12.33: JSX context leaking between requests, XSS via the `cx()` escaping bypass ([#650](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/650))
- `undici` 6.25.0 → 6.28.0: Set-Cookie injection, WebSocket fragment DoS, keep-alive queue poisoning, SameSite downgrade. Staying on 6.x deliberately — 7.x would raise the Node floor to 20 ([#650](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/650))

## [2.8.0] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- macOS stopped asking for the login keychain on every launch. The official CLI reads `cli_auth_credentials_store` from `config.toml`, and we only wrote it during a login or switch — so a third-party front-end running the official binary kept hitting the keychain ([#641](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/641), [#642](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/642))
- Interactive sessions no longer reindex your session history on every launch. They run against your real Codex home instead of a temporary copy ([#639](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/639), [#643](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/643))
- `doctor --fix` can repair the credential store directly, and reports correctly on a machine with no accounts yet ([#642](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/642))

### Changed

- `cli_auth_credentials_store` is written on first run and re-checked on startup, not just during a login or switch. Opt out with `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_ENFORCE_CLI_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0` ([#642](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/642))
- Two interactive sessions can now run at once against the same state, the same as running the official CLI twice ([#639](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/639))

## [2.7.1] - 2026-07-24

A bug hunt. Two of these could route to the wrong account or stall refreshes machine-wide. [Full notes](docs/releases/v2.7.1.md).

### Fixed

- A manual pin could route to a different account than the one you pinned. Pins are held by position, and account removal only remapped the active index — so removing a revoked account silently shifted your pin ([#638](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/638))
- One failed refresh blocked refreshes for every process for 20 seconds, because failures were cached alongside successes ([#637](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/637))
- A refresh waiting on the shared lease could be evicted and start a second refresh for the same token, which fails with `invalid_grant` on a healthy account ([#637](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/637))
- Monthly (Codex Business) windows were labelled `5h` ([#635](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/635), [#636](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/636))
- An account at 100% used with no reset time could still be recommended as your best option ([#637](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/637))
- Exhaustion was decided on a rounded percentage, so `99.6%` used benched an account that still had quota ([#637](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/637))
- `import` and legacy migration dropped your pin and reset the affinity counter ([#637](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/637))
- Session trimming cut the leading instructions it had just decided to keep ([#637](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/637))
- A timed-out request never got its token back, gradually starving the bucket ([#637](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/637))
- Project- and profile-scoped budgets never applied — stored under a normalised key, looked up with the raw one ([#637](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/637))

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- `check` now shows when each quota window resets, not just how much is left ([#633](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/633))

### Fixed

- Quota percentages kept their red/yellow/green colouring once a reset time was appended ([#633](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/633))

## [2.6.1] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- OAuth login on WSL. No browser ever opened, because WSL reports itself as Linux and `xdg-open` isn't installed there. It now opens the Windows browser ([#630](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/630))
- The manual-paste clipboard copied to the distro's clipboard rather than the Windows one you paste from ([#630](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/630))
- A lost OAuth callback now explains the Windows/WSL port conflict instead of just timing out ([#630](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/630))

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Diagnostics probe with GPT-5.6, falling back for accounts without access ([#627](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/627))

### Fixed

- GPT-5.6 now appears in older Codex builds' model pickers ([#626](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/626))
- Upgrades no longer miss newly shipped models — the config installer merged the provider block shallowly, so an upgraded config never gained anything new ([#626](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/626))
- The wrapper understands GPT-5.6. It re-implements the model map and never got the v2.5.0 work, so `gpt-5.6-*` requests silently resolved to `gpt-5.5` ([#626](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/626))

### Changed

- `pidOffsetEnabled` defaults on, so parallel agents spread across accounts instead of all picking the same one and cascading into `429`s ([#628](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/628))

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- GPT-5.6 (Sol, Terra, Luna) as first-class models, plus the `max` and `ultra` reasoning tiers above `xhigh`. `ultra` is rewritten to `max` before the request is sent, matching upstream

### Fixed

- `gpt-5.1-codex-max` is a model id, not Codex at max effort — it was nearly rerouted onto plain `gpt-5.1-codex`
- Unrecognised `gpt-5.6-*` ids silently ran GPT-5.5

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- `codex-multi-auth-codex --account <index|email|id>` forces one invocation onto a single account. Ephemeral (never touches your saved pin) and fail-hard (never silently uses a different account) ([#623](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/623), [#624](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/624))

## [2.3.3] - 2026-06-19

Nine fixes across rate limiting, refresh, streaming, and storage. [Full notes](docs/releases/v2.3.3.md).

### Fixed

- A single bad `retry-after` could bench an account for 31 years. Windows are now clamped to 7 days ([#617](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/617))
- A slow refresh could delete a lock it no longer owned, leaving two processes refreshing at once — and since refresh tokens are single-use, logging the account out ([#617](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/617))
- A routine save could revert a freshly rotated token, permanently breaking that account's next refresh ([#617](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/617))
- A transient `429` benched an account for hours by folding the healthy weekly window into the retry delay ([#617](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/617))
- `forecast` recommended a strictly worse account, because it took the longest of both quota windows rather than the binding one ([#617](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/617))
- Upstream streaming failures were reported to the client as success, with the account recorded as healthy and retry suppressed ([#617](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/617), [#618](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/618))
- The SSE parser required a space after `data:`, so a spec-valid line parsed as zero events ([#617](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/617))
- The V1→V3 storage migration discarded migrated account bodies, so a rate-limited account read as available and could burst `429`s ([#619](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/619))
- OAuth `expires_in` accepted zero and negative values, minting an already-expired token and driving a tight refresh loop ([#619](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/619))

## [2.3.2] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- An orphaned app-bind left `config.toml` pointing at a dead proxy with no CLI way out. `rotation unbind-app` now self-heals without a backup, and `rotation status` reports "bound but unmanaged" instead of "not configured" ([#614](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/614))

## [2.3.1] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- `codex-multi-auth history` lists every local Codex session regardless of provider. `codex resume` filters by the provider recorded in each session, so rotation hides sessions created under the native provider — the files were always there ([#612](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/612))

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- A permanent `503` that wedged rotation even with healthy accounts. Recovery reloaded from disk, restoring the same state that had wedged the pool, and the guard refused to run in exactly the situation it existed for ([#606](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/606), [#607](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/607))
- Two cooldown paths changed account state without scheduling the write, so a restart dropped it ([#608](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/608), [#609](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/609))

## [2.3.0-beta.3] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- Streaming stalled indefinitely for slow clients, buffering without bound
- Account deduplication needed more than one pass; it now loops until stable

### Security

- Atomic writes use `crypto.randomBytes` for temporary filenames instead of `Math.random()` ([#517](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/517))

## [2.3.0-beta.2] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Opt-in `sequential` scheduling drains one account before moving to the next, so quota windows stagger instead of resetting together ([#509](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/509))

### Fixed

- Drain-first mode advanced its pointer on a transient fallback, breaking the invariant it exists for
- An expired token could be forwarded after a successful refresh, producing a `401` and a wrong invalidation cooldown
- Flagged-account restore dropped workspaces, so a multi-workspace account lost its list permanently
- A transient disk failure during quota-cache reload wiped every other account's data
- Login reported `Added account` when it had updated or rebound an existing one ([#512](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/512))
- `login --manual` reported every failure as `Cancelled`, including a malformed URL and a state mismatch ([#512](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/512))

### Security

- CI workflow steps pinned to exact commit SHAs ([#519](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/519))
- Response headers under our own namespace are blocked by prefix, so a header added later is blocked by default ([#546](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/issues/546))

## [2.2.2] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- `forecast` reported working accounts as unavailable. `token-exhausted` has no natural expiry and nothing cleared it, so it lingered indefinitely — a successful request now clears it

## [2.1.3] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- Wrapper-launched sessions repair `session_index.jsonl` after known thread-store write damage, serialised so concurrent sessions can't collide
- App-bind status warnings resolve the active status path before printing guidance

## [2.1.2] - 2026-04-30

### Removed

- The global `codex` bin, which collided with the official Codex npm, native, and Homebrew installs. `codex-multi-auth` and `codex-multi-auth-codex` are unchanged

## [2.1.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- `usage`, `account`, `budget`, `bridge`, `integrations`, `models`, and `monitor` were falling through to the official Codex CLI instead of being handled locally
- `bridge token list --json` returned invalid JSON on an empty store, and included token hashes

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Local-only usage ledger, account policy metadata, routing profiles, and budget guards
- Model and account capability matrix, with policy evaluated before account selection
- Optional loopback-only bridge with `/health`, `/v1/models`, and `/v1/responses`
- `rotation reset-rate-limits` to clear stale runtime timers

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- Runtime rotation is enabled by default. Opt out with `rotation disable`, `codexRuntimeRotationProxy=false`, or `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_RUNTIME_ROTATION_PROXY=0`

### Fixed

- Install and update self-heal the packaged app bind and launcher routing

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- The runtime rotation proxy: failover across accounts mid-session, without restarting Codex. Loopback-only with an authenticated local client key
- `rotation enable|disable|status|bind-app|unbind-app`, with app binding fully reversible

### Fixed

- The proxy left a stale `content-encoding` header on responses it had decoded

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Interactive forwarded sessions were capturing output, which broke TTY use. TTY sessions now inherit terminal stdio; non-TTY runs still capture so model-fallback can inspect errors ([#437](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/437))

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.5 Pro as first-attempt models, with deterministic fallback for older runtimes and accounts without access ([#435](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/435))

### Fixed

- Model fallback now only triggers on a real upstream unsupported-model or no-access response ([#435](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/435))

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `why-selected` explains which account rotation picked and why ([#410](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/410))
- `verify --paths` for path-safety inspection ([#410](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/410))
- A feature-flagged routing mutex for safer concurrent selection, off by default ([#412](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/412))

### Fixed

- Post-audit hardening across OAuth URL redaction, redirect-URI handling, selector null handling, short-`429` retry ordering, recovery writes, and malformed SSE warnings

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Codex CLI sync: target detection, import adapters, named backup wrappers, and sync orchestration. Codex CLI state stays mirror-only ([#72](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/72))

### Fixed

- Cleared accounts could revive themselves when the initial delete partially failed ([#71](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/71))

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- The first consolidated `codex-multi-auth` release, bringing runtime, TUI, account management, and docs into one package ([#4](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/4), [#14](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/14))
- Rotating backup fallback, and automatic promotion of a real backup when primary storage holds fixture data ([#29](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/29))
- Hardened Windows command routing across `codex.bat`, `codex.cmd`, and `codex.ps1` ([#27](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/27))

### Fixed

- Codex CLI account switching stabilised, and storage identity fixed across worktree branch changes ([#27](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/27), [#28](https://github.com/ndycode/codex-multi-auth/pull/28))

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Updates could reset your accounts when storage was only reachable through recovery artifacts
- Codex CLI sync wrote auth to a different profile directory than `CODEX_HOME`
- Account switches now fail fast when the required Codex auth write doesn't complete

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- A Windows crash (`UV_HANDLE_CLOSING`) on wrapper shutdown, after the command had already completed

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Stuck refresh lanes and duplicate refresh churn, via token normalisation and stale/timeout recovery
- `switch <index>` keeps local selection deterministic and reports sync failures clearly

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- `switch <index>` reported failure when only the optional Codex host-state sync was unavailable — the local switch had succeeded

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Rotating backup recovery across `.bak`, `.bak.1`, and `.bak.2`, staged then committed so a failure can't leave a partial history chain
- Startup cleanup for orphaned staging files from interrupted writes, which could otherwise sit around holding token material

### Fixed

- Windows home resolution now tries `USERPROFILE` → `HOME` → `HOMEDRIVE`+`HOMEPATH` → `homedir()`

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- The OAuth callback is pinned to `127.0.0.1:1455` rather than `localhost`, which never arrived on machines resolving IPv6 first
- A clean global install could fail at startup; the `codex` bin now lazy-loads the auth runtime

### Changed

- Account emails dedupe case-insensitively
- Per-project storage is shared across linked Git worktrees
- The settings hub was split into five focused modules; `Q` now cancels without saving

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- The first stable release: multi-account OAuth for Codex
- The `codex auth ...` command family for login, switching, diagnostics, and reporting
- Dashboard settings hub and backend reliability controls
- Rotation and resilience modules for refresh, quota deferral, and failover
