## Security Model

`codex-multi-auth` handles OAuth credentials and account metadata locally.

Key controls:

- PKCE-based OAuth flow.
- Local storage under `~/.codex/multi-auth` (or `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR`).
- Refresh-token lifecycle management and account health isolation.
- Runtime rotation proxy is loopback-only, enabled by default, and authenticated with a local client key. Users can opt out with `codex-multi-auth rotation disable` or `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_RUNTIME_ROTATION_PROXY=0`.
- Packaged Codex app bind is reversible and stores backup/router metadata under `~/.codex/multi-auth/app-bind/`.
- No project-owned telemetry backend.

---

## Operator Security Practices

- Do not share `~/.codex/` directories.
- Never commit auth files, logs, or cache artifacts.
- Review connected apps in ChatGPT settings periodically.
- Enable debug/body logging only for short-lived troubleshooting sessions.

Sensitive logging toggles:

- `ENABLE_PLUGIN_REQUEST_LOGGING=1` (metadata)
- `CODEX_PLUGIN_LOG_BODIES=1` (raw bodies; sensitive)

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a vulnerability:

1. Do not open a public issue.
2. Contact the maintainer privately via GitHub profile contact channel.
3. Include:
   - vulnerability description
   - reproduction steps
   - impact assessment
   - suggested mitigation (optional)

Target response time: within 48 hours.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

- Fixes are prepared before public disclosure.
- Reporter attribution is provided unless anonymity is requested.
- Disclosure timing is coordinated to reduce user risk.

---

## Out of Scope

The following are not treated as vulnerabilities in this repository:

- OpenAI platform outages.
- Account/subscription entitlement limitations.
- Expected upstream rate limiting.
- Requests to bypass OpenAI terms or controls.

## Dependency and Release Hygiene

Security override rationale (`package.json` -> `overrides`):

- `hono`: pinned to `4.12.33` to keep builds out of the vulnerable `<4.12.33` range. This covers the earlier `GHSA-3hrh-pfw6-9m5x`, `GHSA-2gcr-mfcq-wcc3`, `GHSA-xrhx-7g5j-rcj5`, and `GHSA-f577-qrjj-4474` advisories (Set-Cookie injection, `app.mount()` path-decoding, IPv6 IP-restriction bypass, and JWT scheme-acceptance) plus `GHSA-hvrm-45r6-mjfj` and `GHSA-w62v-xxxg-mg59` (JSX per-request context disclosure and XSS via the `cx()` escaping bypass), both of which reach `<=4.12.26`.
- `rollup`: pinned to `^4.59.0` to keep the Vite and Vitest transitive graph above the vulnerable `<4.59.0` range surfaced by `npm audit`.
- `brace-expansion`: pinned to `5.0.9` to lift the dev graph above the ReDoS ranges `>=2.0.0 <2.1.3` and `>=4.0.0 <5.0.8`. Transitive dev-only, so the pin is the practical fix rather than waiting on each consumer to bump.
- `postcss`: pinned to `8.5.25` to clear the `<=8.5.17` advisory reaching the dev graph through the Vite toolchain.

Runtime dependency pin rationale (`package.json` -> `dependencies`):

- `undici`: pinned exactly to `6.28.0`. It is the only runtime HTTP dependency (proxy `ProxyAgent` dispatch and the fetch fallback in the local bridge), it drives the published `engines.node >=18.17.0` floor, and its dispatcher behavior is part of the rotation proxy's tested surface — so version movement is taken deliberately via an explicit bump, never silently through a range. `6.28.0` is the first `6.x` release clear of `GHSA-p88m-4jfj-68fv`, `GHSA-vxpw-j846-p89q`, `GHSA-35p6-xmwp-9g52`, and `GHSA-g8m3-5g58-fq7m` (Set-Cookie header injection, WebSocket fragment DoS, keep-alive response-queue poisoning, and SameSite downgrade), all of which reach `<=6.26.0`. Moving to the undici `7.x` line is deferred until Node 18 support is dropped, since `7.x` raises the runtime floor to Node 20.

Before release and after dependency changes:

```bash
npm run audit:ci
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```
