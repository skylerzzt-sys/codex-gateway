# Local Governance Status

> **Historical record — completed work.** This document is a planning artifact from the
> April 2026 local-governance effort. Every roadmap item below shipped in 2.1.0 and 2.2.0;
> the package is now on the 2.x line well past those releases. Branch names, "Ready for
> review" statuses, version stamps, and test counts are preserved as written at the time and
> are **not** current repository state. For how these features behave today see
> [../../reference/commands.md](../../reference/commands.md),
> [../../reference/settings.md](../../reference/settings.md), and [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Current Notes

- `dist/` is generated output and must not be edited or committed.
- The initial baseline produced one snapshot working-tree marker with no content
  diff; it was restored before creating PR 01.
- If any future baseline or PR gate fails, record exact failure text in
  `open-issues.md`.
