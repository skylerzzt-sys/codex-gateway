# PR 01 Handoff: Local Governance Roadmap

> **Historical record — completed work.** This document is a planning artifact from the
> April 2026 local-governance effort. Every roadmap item below shipped in 2.1.0 and 2.2.0;
> the package is now on the 2.x line well past those releases. Branch names, "Ready for
> review" statuses, version stamps, and test counts are preserved as written at the time and
> are **not** current repository state. For how these features behave today see
> [../../../reference/commands.md](../../../reference/commands.md),
> [../../../reference/settings.md](../../../reference/settings.md), and [../../ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md).
