# Configuration Flow

How configuration is resolved at runtime from files, env, and defaults.

* * *

## 1) Root Directory Resolution

Runtime root priority (`getCodexMultiAuthDir`):

1. `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR` when set
2. If `CODEX_HOME` is an explicit non-default path: **only** `$CODEX_HOME/multi-auth` (no cross-root scan)
3. Otherwise prefer candidate roots under `CODEX_HOME` / `~/.codex` that already hold account storage
4. Fall back to `~/.codex/multi-auth` (canonical default) or other roots that already show multi-auth signals
5. Legacy path fallback only when storage signals exist

Canonical target is `~/.codex/multi-auth` when no override is set.

* * *

## 2) Unified Settings Resolution

`settings.json` is read for:

- `dashboardDisplaySettings`
- `pluginConfig`

If legacy config exists, compatibility load and migration path still apply.

* * *

## 3) Runtime Value Precedence

For runtime values stored in `pluginConfig`, source selection is:

1. Fallback file from `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_CONFIG_PATH` when set **and the file exists** (also the preferred save target when set)
2. Unified settings `pluginConfig` from `settings.json` (if present and valid)
3. Legacy compatibility path when unified config is missing/invalid
4. Hardcoded default in `DEFAULT_PLUGIN_CONFIG`

After source selection, environment variables apply per-setting overrides.

A `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_CONFIG_PATH` that is set but not yet created is ignored for load; the first save still creates/writes that path when the env var remains set.

For dashboard display values:

1. Persisted `dashboardDisplaySettings`
2. Normalization + fallback defaults

* * *

## 4) Account Storage Path Flow

1. Resolve root directory.
2. Use global accounts file by default.
3. If project-scoped mode is active, use project namespaced path under root.
4. Attempt legacy project-file migration when applicable.

* * *

## 5) Command Routing Flow

1. Standalone manager receives `codex-multi-auth ...` and normalizes bare subcommands to `auth ...` before dispatch.
2. Optional wrapper receives `codex-multi-auth-codex ...`, normalizes compatibility aliases, and runs auth-manager commands locally.
3. If a wrapper command is not in auth-manager scope, discover and forward to the official Codex CLI binary.
4. For forwarded request-bearing commands, check whether runtime rotation is enabled.

* * *

## 6) Runtime Rotation Flow

1. Resolve `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_RUNTIME_ROTATION_PROXY`; if unset, read `pluginConfig.codexRuntimeRotationProxy`, which defaults to enabled.
2. If disabled or the forwarded command is help/non-requesting, forward directly to official Codex.
3. If enabled, start a loopback Responses proxy with a per-process client token.
4. Select a transport from the forwarded argv:
   - **No forwarded subcommand (interactive TUI)** — keep the canonical `CODEX_HOME` and pass `codex-multi-auth-runtime-proxy` as ephemeral `-c model_providers.*` overrides. Nothing is copied, no provider or transport config is written into `config.toml`, and the helper detaches on exit. The transport-independent `cli_auth_credentials_store` reconcile below still applies.
   - **`resume` / `fork`** — the same canonical-home transport as the interactive TUI. These resume an existing thread, and the shadow home omits the runtime SQLite state, so the shadow transport could not see the requested thread (#647).
   - **`codex app`** — run the app runtime helper against a shadow `CODEX_HOME`.
   - **Any other request-bearing command** — create a temporary shadow `CODEX_HOME` and rewrite its `config.toml` to use `codex-multi-auth-runtime-proxy`.
5. Forward official Codex with the selected home.
6. Proxy request handling selects/refreshes managed accounts and rotates on rate limit, auth, network, or server failure before streaming starts.
7. On process exit, shadow-home transports sync refreshed official Codex state files back and remove the shadow home. The canonical-home transport wrote state in place, so there is nothing to sync.

Independently of the transport, the wrapper reconciles the top-level `cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"` assignment in the real `~/.codex/config.toml` at startup (idempotent; see `lib/codex-cli/writer.ts`). That is the only key this project persists into the official config.

* * *

## 7) Request Handling Flow (Plugin Host)

1. Transform request for Codex backend compatibility.
2. Resolve account candidate set (health, cooldown, quota, affinity).
3. Execute request with timeout/retry policy.
4. Apply failover/rotation/cooldown decisions.
5. Persist account/cache/session updates.

* * *

## 8) Unsupported Model / Entitlement Flow

1. Detect unsupported model or entitlement failures.
2. Record in entitlement cache.
3. Apply capability penalties for account/model pair.
4. Use fallback model policy if enabled.
5. Re-evaluate account scoring and retry path.

* * *

## 9) Live Runtime Sync Flow

1. File watcher detects account-file updates.
2. Debounce and reload in-memory account manager.
3. Session affinity and guardian processes continue with updated state.

* * *

## 10) Debugging Effective Config

Use:

```bash
codex-multi-auth status
codex-multi-auth report --json
codex-multi-auth rotation status
```

Check files:

- `~/.codex/multi-auth/settings.json`
- `~/.codex/multi-auth/openai-codex-accounts.json`
