# Testing Guide

Testing strategy and release gate for runtime, CLI, and docs consistency.

* * *

## Test Stack

| Layer | Tooling |
| --- | --- |
| Unit/integration tests | Vitest (`test/**/*.test.ts`) |
| Type checks | TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| Linting | ESLint |
| Coverage | Vitest V8 coverage |

Coverage thresholds in `vitest.config.ts`: statements/branches/functions/lines >= `80`.

* * *

## Core Commands

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

Optional:

```bash
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage
npm test -- test/documentation.test.ts
npm test -- test/runtime-rotation-proxy.test.ts test/codex-bin-wrapper.test.ts
npm run test:model-matrix:smoke
npm run bench:edit-formats:smoke
```

* * *

## Recommended Local Gate Before PR

1. `npm run typecheck`
2. `npm run lint`
3. `npm test`
4. `npm run build`
5. run docs command checks for newly documented command paths

## Auth/Account Change Test Matrix

| Area | Minimum checks |
| --- | --- |
| Login flow | `codex-multi-auth login` completes and stores real account data |
| Switching flow | `codex-multi-auth switch <index>` updates active account behavior |
| Health operations | `check`, `forecast`, `fix`, `doctor`, `report` produce sane output |
| Storage durability | backup/WAL recovery remains valid |
| CLI state sync | active account sync with Codex CLI files |
| Runtime rotation | localhost proxy startup, request forwarding, account rotation, shadow-home sync-back, app-helper status |
| Local governance | usage ledger, account policies, routing profiles, budget guards, runtime policy, monitor aggregation |
| Local bridge | loopback-only health/models/responses forwarding, bearer token checks, integration snippets |
| Packaged app bind | config backup/restore, router startup state, startup entry cleanup |
| Live updates | account changes picked up without restart |
| Concurrency race safety | refresh/write races covered by deterministic tests |
| Windows transient FS handling | retry behavior for `EBUSY`/`EPERM` paths |

* * *

## Manual Smoke Pack

```bash
codex-multi-auth login
codex-multi-auth list
codex-multi-auth check
codex-multi-auth forecast --live
codex-multi-auth fix --dry-run
codex-multi-auth doctor --fix --dry-run
codex-multi-auth report --live --json
codex-multi-auth usage --since 24h --by outcome
codex-multi-auth monitor --json
codex-multi-auth bridge token create --label smoke
codex-multi-auth integrations --kind python
```

Optional plugin-host smoke:

```bash
<run-your-host-runtime-smoke-command>
```

Runtime rotation smoke:

```bash
codex-multi-auth rotation status
codex-multi-auth-codex exec "say hello" --model gpt-5.5
```

For live smoke evidence, confirm the official Codex startup/status output uses provider `codex-multi-auth-runtime-proxy` and a localhost Responses URL. Account/quota failures after that point can still prove routing if the provider and localhost path are visible.

## Failure-Mode Scenarios

| Scenario | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- |
| OAuth callback port conflict | clean error and retry path |
| Invalid/expired refresh token | account flagged/disabled by policy tools |
| All accounts rate-limited | forecast/report show wait and recommendation |
| Runtime rotation pool exhausted | proxy returns `codex_runtime_rotation_pool_exhausted` with `codex-multi-auth rotation status` hint |
| Runtime proxy upstream compression | decoded client bytes are not paired with stale `content-encoding` |
| Shadow-home sync owner write failure | orphaned lock is removed or retried so later sync-back is not silently skipped |
| Storage write error | `StorageError` has actionable hint |
| Unsupported model | policy fallback or strict failure as configured |
| Stream stalls | stream failover logic engages by policy |

* * *

## Refactor Guardrail Checklist

Before approving a large runtime, manager, or storage refactor, run the narrow suites that protect the highest-risk invariants:

```bash
npm test -- test/index.test.ts test/index-retry.test.ts
npm test -- test/runtime-rotation-proxy.test.ts test/runtime-rotation-proxy-safe-equal.test.ts test/codex-bin-wrapper.test.ts
npm test -- test/codex-manager-cli.test.ts
npm test -- test/storage.test.ts test/storage-async.test.ts test/storage-recovery-paths.test.ts test/paths.test.ts
```

Key guardrails to watch:

- request invariants stay locked: `stream: true`, `store: false`, and `reasoning.encrypted_content`
- runtime rotation stays default-on, loopback-only, and authenticated with local client keys
- shadow-home cleanup and sync-back remain safe under Windows-style `EBUSY`/`EPERM` failures
- storage failures still produce actionable `StorageError` hints
- linked-worktree and forged-path protections remain covered by `test/paths.test.ts`

Runbooks for common maintenance tasks:

- [RUNBOOK_ADD_AUTH_COMMAND.md](RUNBOOK_ADD_AUTH_COMMAND.md)
- [RUNBOOK_ADD_CONFIG_FIELD.md](RUNBOOK_ADD_CONFIG_FIELD.md)
- [RUNBOOK_CHANGE_ROUTING_POLICY.md](RUNBOOK_CHANGE_ROUTING_POLICY.md)

* * *

## Docs QA (when docs change)

1. Verify every command snippet is runnable.
2. Cross-check path references against runtime modules.
3. Confirm cross-links are valid.
4. Keep feature matrix in sync with implemented features.
