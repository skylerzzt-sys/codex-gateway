# Architecture

Runtime architecture for the Codex CLI wrapper, local OAuth account manager, default-on Responses rotation proxy, optional local bridge, local governance (usage/budget/policy), and optional plugin-host bridge.

* * *

## Design Goals

1. Keep account management simple for end users (`codex-multi-auth ...`).
2. Preserve official Codex CLI behavior for non-auth commands.
3. Route live account rotation by default while keeping explicit opt-out controls.
4. Keep runtime rotation local, reversible, and compatible with official Codex state files.
5. Preserve stateless backend request compatibility (`store: false`) unless explicit background-response compatibility is enabled.
6. Keep plugin-host integration available without making it the default user path.
7. Keep local governance (usage ledger, budgets, account policies, routing profiles) file-backed and opt-in at the operator command surface.

## Account Selection Order

Runtime proxy account selection is implemented in `lib/runtime/rotation-account-selection.ts` (`chooseAccount`). Order of precedence:

1. **Pin** — manual pin from `codex-multi-auth switch <index>` (persisted `pinnedAccountIndex`), or ephemeral force pin from `codex-multi-auth-codex --account` / `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_ACCOUNT` resolved to `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_ACCOUNT_INDEX`. A pin overrides every other signal. The proxy does not call `markSwitched` for a manual pin so it does not clobber the CLI pin.
2. **Sequential \| affinity**
   - When `schedulingStrategy === "sequential"` (drain-first): stick to the active account until it is fully exhausted, then scan forward; **session affinity is skipped** so all new requests follow the single active account.
   - Otherwise, if session affinity is enabled and a preferred account exists for the session key, use that account when it is still eligible.
3. **Hybrid** — weighted health + token-bucket + freshness selection (`selectHybridAccount` / `getCurrentOrNextForFamilyHybrid`), including optional PID offset and policy score boosts.
4. **Scan** — linear pool walk for the next eligible account (not already attempted, not policy-blocked, not rate-limited / cooling down / circuit-open). Sequential mode uses this fallback without advancing the drain-first active pointer unless true exhaustion occurred.

Policy evaluation (`lib/policy/runtime-policy.ts`) can block paused/drained accounts, apply tag/model routing-profile constraints, apply score boosts, and soft-block requests that exceed budget guards before selection proceeds.

* * *

## Runtime Rotation Flow

1. The wrapper checks `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_RUNTIME_ROTATION_PROXY` and `codexRuntimeRotationProxy`.
2. If disabled, the command forwards to the official Codex CLI unchanged except for normal wrapper compatibility settings.
3. If enabled, `createRuntimeRotationProxyContextIfEnabled` (`scripts/codex.js`) picks a transport from the forwarded argv. There are two homes — canonical and shadow — reached over four selection branches, because the canonical-home branches differ in helper lifetime and shim installation. The table splits the first branch into its two predicates for clarity:

   | Branch | Predicate | Transport |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Interactive TUI | `isCodexInteractiveTuiCommand` — no forwarded subcommand at all | App runtime helper with `useCanonicalHome: true` and `detachOnExit: true`. Runs against the **canonical** `CODEX_HOME`; the provider is passed as ephemeral `-c model_providers.*` overrides. No shadow copy and no state sync-back. Nothing **provider- or transport-related** is written into `config.toml` on this path — the only top-level key the wrapper still reconciles there is `cli_auth_credentials_store`, which is transport-independent (see step 4 note). |
   | Interactive `resume` / `fork` | `isCodexInteractiveResumeCommand` — forwarded command is `resume` or `fork` | Same transport and options as the interactive TUI above. These open a TUI against an existing thread, so they must see the canonical thread index. |
   | `app-server` | `isCodexAppServerCommand` — forwarded command is `app-server` | App runtime helper with `useCanonicalHome: true`, `detachOnExit: false`, `installAppServerShim: false`, and `proxyAppServerAccountRead: true`. Same canonical home as the interactive branches; the differences are that a resident server owns its proxy for its whole lifetime rather than detaching it, and that the account-response rewriting is requested explicitly because no shim is present to set the label env. |
   | `codex app` | `isCodexAppCommand` — forwarded command is `app` | App runtime helper process with a shadow `CODEX_HOME`, plus the app-server CLI shim. |
   | Everything else | request-bearing forwarded command | Shadow `CODEX_HOME` created inline by the wrapper process. |

4. The wrapper starts `lib/runtime-rotation-proxy.ts` on `127.0.0.1` with a per-process client API key. Shadow-home branches copy relevant official Codex state and rewrite `config.toml` to select `codex-multi-auth-runtime-proxy`; the canonical-home branches instead inject the same provider through `-c` arguments and pass the client key via `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
5. The official Codex CLI sends Responses/model traffic to the local provider.
6. The proxy validates the client token, evaluates runtime policy, selects a managed account, refreshes tokens if needed, and forwards to the official backend.
7. The proxy rotates to another account before streaming response bytes when it sees retryable auth refresh failures, 429s, 5xx responses, or network errors (subject to pin and min-rotation-interval throttling).
8. Successful responses stream back to the local Codex client with hop-by-hop/private/stale decoded headers removed.
9. Usage ledger rows and runtime counters are persisted for status/report/usage/budget commands.
10. On exit, shadow-home branches sync refreshed official state files back and remove the temporary directory. The canonical-home branches have nothing to sync — they read and wrote official state in place.

Why the interactive branch is different: copying the Codex home into a shadow made the official CLI reindex its thread history and SQLite state on every TUI launch. Running interactive sessions against the canonical home keeps that state reusable.

`resume` and `fork` belong to that same branch for a stronger reason. The shadow mirror deliberately omits the runtime SQLite state (`isRuntimeRotationShadowHomeOmittedEntry`), so a shadow home only ever holds a partial thread index rebuilt from the linked `sessions` directory. Resuming a thread that the shadow index does not contain left the TUI on a blank screen forever, while the same command worked under the official CLI and with the proxy disabled. Routing both commands to the canonical home is what makes the thread visible (#647).

`app-server` is the third member of that set, and the shadow home broke it twice over (#659). The mirror links directories rather than copying them, and Codex applies an `lstat`-strict check to `<CODEX_HOME>/app-server-control`, so on any machine where a previous app-server had created that directory the server refused to start at all. Where it did start, the frozen thread index was not a per-launch annoyance but a divergence held for the process's whole life and handed to every attached client, with anything the server created written into a copy discarded at exit.

The app-server CLI shim is deliberately **not** installed on that branch. Its only purpose is to let a Codex process that spawns its own `codex app-server` through `CODEX_CLI_PATH` — the desktop app — have that spawn routed back through the wrapper. Installing it is neither free nor inert: it copies the Node image into a per-pid directory (a full ~100 MB `copyFileSync` on Windows, repeated on every supervised restart) and stamps `CODEX_CLI_PATH`, `NODE_OPTIONS=--import=<preload>`, and `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_RUNTIME_ROTATION_PROXY=0` onto the environment the forwarded child inherits. That last one is the dangerous one for a resident server: Codex passes its environment to shell tools and MCP servers, so every nested `codex-multi-auth-codex` invocation would read rotation as disabled and bill whatever account the official CLI resolved — a silent billing error, and exactly what routing `app-server` through rotation exists to prevent.

Because no shim means no `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_SERVER_ACCOUNT_LABEL` in the forwarded environment, the branch asks for `account/read` / `getAuthStatus` / `account/rateLimits/read` rewriting through the explicit `proxyAppServerAccountRead` option instead. The option is load-bearing: dropping it fails `test/codex-bin-wrapper.test.ts`'s account-response tests.

A helper that cannot start is a hard failure on all of these branches — unlike the shadow path, there is no rotation-off shape left to degrade into, and quietly serving a resident server unrotated is worse than not serving it. Hard means a diagnostic on stderr and exit 1, not an unhandled rejection: `createRuntimeRotationProxyContextIfEnabled` catches the launch failure, releases the compatibility home the caller already built, and returns a `startupError` that `forwardToRealCodex` turns into an exit code before the official CLI is ever spawned.

Helper self-reaping is identity-checked and bounded. A detached helper decides "is my launcher still alive" by PID **plus the launcher's kernel start time** (passed at spawn via `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_OWNER_START_TIME_MS`), and reaps itself on whichever of three deadlines comes first.

| Rule | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Owner identity | PID plus kernel start time. A bare `kill(pid, 0)` cannot tell a launcher from a later process that recycled its PID, and because the idle deadline only ever moved forward, one false "alive" was never corrected — helpers were observed running 33 hours past a 12-hour idle timeout, hundreds deep. |
| Recheck cadence | At most once a minute; a `ps` spawn per tick would cost more than it saves. A *failed* re-read keeps the previous verdict rather than declaring a live owner dead — under the process-table pressure this exists for, `fork` itself can fail. |
| Degraded check | Where no start time is known at all, the check degrades to bare liveness. That is the *normal* case on Windows, not an edge case: the start time comes from `ps`, which does not exist there, so both probes short-circuit rather than spawning a process that could only fail. Windows therefore runs owner liveness on `kill(pid, 0)` alone, and the lifetime ceiling below is what bounds a leak there. |
| Idle timeout | `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_IDLE_MS`, default 12h, refreshed by traffic and by a live owner. |
| Detached window | `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_DETACHED_IDLE_MS`, default 15m, `0` disables. Applies from the moment the owner is *confirmed* dead — a helper with no recorded owner PID is not a helper whose owner is dead, and stays on the idle timeout. The detach grace hands helpers off optimistically — any launcher exiting cleanly within it leaves its helper running — so every short forwarded command stranded a helper that then held the full idle timeout with no owner, no traffic, and nothing connected. The window only reaps a helper that has **never served a request**: every leaked helper in #663 had `totalRequests: 0`, while a live `codex app` session that is merely idle between turns holds no socket either (the proxy leaves `keepAliveTimeout` at Node's 5s default), so reaping on the socket check alone would kill a working proxy under the desktop app. A helper that served anything falls back to the idle timeout and the lifetime ceiling. |
| Connection gating | The detached window fires only while the proxy reports zero open client connections *and* the helper has never served a request. The connection check alone is not enough, because the proxy leaves `keepAliveTimeout` at Node's 5s default: a `codex app` session idle between turns holds no socket, so socket-only gating would reap a working proxy out from under the desktop app. Having served anything is the durable evidence of a handoff, and every helper in the leak report had `totalRequests: 0`. An unreadable connection count or request counter fails open into reaping: treating "unknown" as "attached" would restore the leak for any shape that stopped answering. |
| Lifetime ceiling | `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_MAX_LIFETIME_MS`, default 24h, `0` disables. Unconditional on activity — the backstop that turns any future accounting bug into a bounded leak instead of an unbounded one. |
| Telemetry | Per process: each helper publishes `runtime-rotation-app-helper.<pid>.json` (the un-suffixed legacy path is still read for pre-upgrade helpers), publishes only on change plus a heartbeat rather than every tick, and removes its owner file on exit. Each launcher sweeps metadata files whose helper PID is dead immediately *after* spawning its own helper — the sweep is synchronous and unbounded, and the state it cleans up is exactly the state that makes it slow, so it must never sit in front of `codex app` or TUI startup. Terminal status stamps survive until that sweep, long enough to be read without accumulating forever. `rotation unbind-app` reclaims the same metadata independently, which is the only repair path on a machine that stopped launching helpers. |

The published `idleExpiresAt` reports whichever of these deadlines is actually enforced, so `rotation status` cannot advertise 12h to a helper minutes from being reaped. Terminal states are `idle-timeout`, `owner-gone`, `max-lifetime`, `stopped`, and `error`; only `running` means running.

Helper shutdown is bounded rather than best-effort. `stopRuntimeRotationAppHelper` sends `SIGTERM`, waits out the graceful window, escalates to `SIGKILL` if the helper is still running, and then unconditionally destroys the helper's stdio streams and unrefs the child. That last step is the load-bearing one: the helper is spawned with piped stdio, so a helper that outlives the window — or any process that inherited those pipes — keeps the wrapper's event loop referenced and the shell prompt never returns. On Windows the signals are emulated as unconditional termination, so the stream teardown is the only part that reliably frees the wrapper there.

Two interactive sessions can therefore run concurrently against the same home — the same as running the official CLI twice — and **no lock is taken over session state**: neither session copies or syncs it, so there is nothing to clobber. Regression coverage lives in `test/codex-bin-wrapper.test.ts`.

Scope that guarantee to session state only. It does **not** extend to `config.toml`: `ensureCodexCliFileAuthStore` (`lib/codex-cli/writer.ts`) still read-modify-writes the canonical file when the store is not already `"file"`, and the atomic write does not serialize cross-process writers. That is safe in practice rather than by locking — the operation is idempotent, converges on a single value, and lands via atomic rename, so concurrent invocations agree instead of interleaving. Anything added to that write path that is *not* idempotent would need a real lock.

Internal env used by these branches (not operator-facing): `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_USE_CANONICAL_HOME`, `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_INSTALL_APP_SERVER_SHIM`, `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_SERVER_CONFIG_ARGS_JSON`, `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_OWNER_PID`, `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_OWNER_START_TIME_MS`, `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_REAL_CODEX_HOME`.

* * *

## Local Bridge Flow

1. Operator creates a local client token via `codex-multi-auth bridge token create` (plaintext shown once; store keeps SHA-256 hash + prefix + label).
2. Bridge listens on loopback only and requires a bearer token by default.
3. Allowed routes: `/health`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/responses`.
4. Authenticated requests forward to a configured runtime proxy base URL (also loopback-only).
5. When the runtime proxy requires a client API key, the bridge rewrites outbound `Authorization` after inbound verification.
6. Usage rows may be appended with source `local-bridge`.

* * *

## Plugin-Host Request Pipeline

High-level optional host flow:

1. Load runtime config and account manager.
2. Normalize incoming model/provider request shape.
3. Enforce Codex backend invariants:
   - `stream: true`
   - `store: false`
   - include `reasoning.encrypted_content`
4. Strip unsupported payload forms for stateless behavior.
5. Select candidate account with health + quota + affinity logic (same selection family as the runtime proxy where applicable).
6. Execute request with timeout/retry/failover policy.
7. Update cooldown/rate-limit/session-affinity state.
8. Persist updated account/cache state.

* * *

## First-Run Setup

Package install scripts stay side-effect-free. On the first durable CLI invocation after install, `lib/runtime/first-run.ts`:

- Claims a one-time marker at `~/.codex/multi-auth/first-run-setup.json` (exclusive create; concurrent claims race safely).
- Runs three best-effort steps, each recording `completed` / `skipped` / `failed` without secrets:
  1. **App bind** — packaged Codex app bind, when rotation is enabled and the environment is not CI/`npx`/project-local.
  2. **Launcher** — user-level launcher routing, under the same gate.
  3. **Auth store** — `ensureCodexCliFileAuthStore()` pins the top-level `cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"` in `~/.codex/config.toml` (`lib/codex-cli/writer.ts`).
- Failures are debug-logged and never block the requested command.

The marker is versioned (`FIRST_RUN_MARKER_VERSION = 2`). Because `ensureFirstRunSetup` short-circuits on marker existence, a marker written before the auth-store step existed (`version: 1`, or any unreadable/truncated marker) is **migrated in place** on the next manager CLI run: only the auth-store step is replayed. App bind and launcher install are deliberately not rerun, so shortcuts the user removed stay removed. The migration takes no exclusive claim — both `ensureCodexCliFileAuthStore` and the atomic marker write are idempotent, so concurrent invocations converge instead of racing.

A **failed** auth-store step deliberately records the pre-v2 version so the next run retries it; otherwise one transient Windows `EPERM`/`EBUSY` on a locked `config.toml` would strand the install on keychain mode permanently. A `skipped` result does advance the version, since that is the normal outcome both for a config already pinned to `"file"` and for an explicit `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_ENFORCE_CLI_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0` opt-out.

Explicit repair remains `codex-multi-auth rotation enable` / `bind-app` / launcher install helpers, plus `codex-multi-auth doctor --fix` for the auth-store pin.

## Storage Model

Canonical multi-auth root: `~/.codex/multi-auth`.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `settings.json` | Unified dashboard + runtime config |
| `openai-codex-accounts.json` | Main account pool |
| `openai-codex-accounts.json.bak` / `.wal` | Backup and recovery journal |
| `openai-codex-flagged-accounts.json` | Flagged account pool |
| `quota-cache.json` | Cached quota snapshots |
| `runtime-observability.json` | Runtime request counters and last-account metadata |
| `first-run-setup.json` | One-time durable-install setup claim marker |
| `account-policies.json` | Tags, weights, pause/drain, notes (hashed account keys) |
| `routing-profiles.json` | Project-aware routing preferences |
| `budget-guards.json` | Local request/token/cost limits |
| `local-client-tokens.json` | Local bridge token hashes (no plaintext) |
| `usage/usage-ledger.jsonl` | Append-only local usage metadata (+ rotated archives) |
| `runtime-rotation-app-helper.<pid>.json` | Wrapper-launched Codex app helper status, one per live helper (the un-suffixed name is the pre-per-PID legacy path, still read) |
| `runtime-rotation-app-helper-owner.<pid>.json` | Owner identity token for a wrapper-launched helper, one per helper; removed by the helper on exit and swept when its PID is dead |
| `app-bind/` | Packaged app bind state, backup metadata, router status/log |
| `logs/` | Diagnostics when logging is enabled |
| `cache/` | Prompt/cache artifacts |
| `projects/<key>/` | Per-project account pools keyed by repo identity root |
| `backups/` | Named operator-exported account-pool backups |

Official Codex-owned files remain under `~/.codex`, including `auth.json`, `accounts.json`, and `config.toml`.

* * *

## Security Boundaries

1. **Loopback only** — runtime rotation proxy, app router, and local bridge bind to loopback hosts (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost` / `::1`). Non-loopback bases are rejected.
2. **Local client authentication** — runtime proxy uses a per-process client API key; local bridge uses operator-managed bearer tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes.
3. **No account PII in client-facing proxy responses** — responses must not include account emails, auth tokens, or stale decoded content-encoding metadata.
4. **Reversible app bind** — packaged app bind edits user `config.toml` + startup metadata only; official app binaries are never patched; disable/unbind restores the backup.
5. **OAuth stays local** — callback server binds port `1455` on loopback; PKCE tokens land in local storage under the multi-auth root.
6. **Usage ledger redaction** — ledger rows store hashed identity fields and request metadata, not prompts, auth headers, or raw emails.
7. **Ephemeral force-account pins** — `--account` / `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_ACCOUNT` never mutate the persisted switch pin and fail hard when the proxy is disabled or the target is unavailable.
8. **Budget guards are soft under concurrency** — evaluations read a pre-request ledger snapshot; concurrent requests may briefly overshoot. This is intentional (best-effort, not a hard distributed quota).
9. **First-run marker is not a secret** — it only records that durable-install self-heal ran; opt-out via env remains available.
10. **The keychain is never touched** — the `cli_auth_credentials_store` reconcile only rewrites a top-level TOML assignment in `~/.codex/config.toml`. No keychain item and no `security` CLI is ever read or written, and credentials saved by an earlier official `codex login` are left in place (unread once the store is pinned to `"file"`). Opt out of the per-invocation `-c` override with `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0`, or of every persisted rewrite with `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_ENFORCE_CLI_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0`.
11. **Canonical-home overrides carry no secret on disk** — the interactive path passes provider config as `-c` arguments and the per-process client key through `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the child environment, so no credential is persisted into the user's `config.toml`.

## TUI Runtime Notes

- TUI v2 is default.
- Palette and accent are configurable.
- Account rows support compact + details views.
- Hotkeys support quick-switch/search/help and per-account actions.
- Settings panels are split by responsibility and preview changes before persistence where applicable.

## Invariants

1. OAuth callback port remains `1455`.
2. Dist folder is generated output only.
3. Non-auth `codex-multi-auth-codex` commands forward to official Codex unless the command is intentionally handled by the local auth manager.
4. Canonical account-management commands remain `codex-multi-auth ...`.
5. Runtime rotation is default-on and loopback-only.
6. Runtime proxy client authentication uses a local per-process token.
7. Runtime proxy client responses must not include account emails, auth tokens, or stale decoded content-encoding metadata.
8. Packaged app bind must be reversible and must not patch official app binaries.
9. Settings Q hotkey = cancel without save; theme live-preview restores baseline on cancel.
10. Email dedup is case-insensitive via `normalizeEmailKey()` (trim + lowercase).
11. Windows filesystem operations use retry helpers for transient `EBUSY`/`EPERM`/`ENOTEMPTY` behavior where lock-prone paths are touched.
12. Account selection order remains pin → sequential|affinity → hybrid → scan unless a release intentionally changes that contract.
13. `mcodex` is a convenience launcher only; it must not reimplement account-manager or Codex command logic.
14. Interactive TUI sessions run against the canonical `CODEX_HOME`. They must not be moved back onto a shadow copy: doing so reintroduces per-launch thread-history reindexing, and the no-lock concurrency guarantee depends on neither session copying or syncing state.
15. The rotation provider is never written into the real `~/.codex/config.toml` on the interactive path. The only top-level key this project reconciles there is `cli_auth_credentials_store`.
16. The keychain is never read or written. Reading a keychain item would raise the prompt the auth-store pin exists to eliminate; a `[profiles.*]` credential-store value is left as authored.
