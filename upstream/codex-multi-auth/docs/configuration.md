# Configuration

Runtime configuration is resolved from unified settings, optional override files, and environment variables.

---

## Canonical Files

| Layer | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unified settings | `~/.codex/multi-auth/settings.json` | Dashboard display and runtime `pluginConfig` |
| Optional config override | `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_CONFIG_PATH=<path>` | External config file source |
| Root override | `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR=<path>` | Re-home settings/accounts/cache/log directories |

---

## Settings Shape

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "dashboardDisplaySettings": {
    "menuAutoFetchLimits": true,
    "menuSortEnabled": true,
    "menuSortMode": "ready-first",

    "streamStallTimeoutMs": 45000
  }
}
```

## Resolution Precedence

Runtime config **source selection** is resolved in this order. The persisted object is still named `pluginConfig` for compatibility with earlier releases.

1. File from `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_CONFIG_PATH` when that env var is set **and the file already exists** (preferred load path; also the save target when set).
2. Unified settings `pluginConfig` from `settings.json` under the multi-auth root (when present and valid).
3. Legacy compatibility config files when unified settings are absent/invalid.
4. Hardcoded defaults in `DEFAULT_PLUGIN_CONFIG`.

After a config source is selected, environment variables override individual runtime settings.
Dashboard display values are resolved from persisted `dashboardDisplaySettings` and then normalized defaults.

Notes:

- A set-but-missing `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_CONFIG_PATH` is ignored for load until the file is created; the next save still writes to that path when the env var is set.
- `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR` re-homes multi-auth-owned files. If `CODEX_HOME` is set to a non-default directory, multi-auth resolves strictly to `$CODEX_HOME/multi-auth` without scanning other roots for existing pools.

## Stable Environment Overrides

These are safe for most operators and frequently used in day-to-day workflows.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR` | Override root directory for multi-auth-managed runtime files |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_CONFIG_PATH` | Load configuration from alternate path |
| `CODEX_MODE=0/1` | Disable or enable Codex mode |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_RUNTIME_ROTATION_PROXY=0/1` | Opt out/in of live Codex Responses routing through the localhost account-rotation proxy |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_ACCOUNT=<index\|email\|id>` | Force one account for a single forwarded `codex-multi-auth-codex` run (equivalent to the `--account` flag, which wins when both are set). Ephemeral and fail-hard; requires the runtime rotation proxy. See [Force an account for one invocation](reference/commands.md#force-an-account-for-one-invocation) |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_IDLE_MS=<ms>` | Override idle shutdown for the wrapper-launched Codex app helper |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_MAX_LIFETIME_MS=<ms>` | Absolute ceiling on a runtime helper's life regardless of activity (default 24h; `0` disables) |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_DETACHED_IDLE_MS=<ms>` | Idle window that applies once a helper's launcher is gone, nothing is connected, and the helper has never served a request (default 15m; `0` restores the full idle timeout) |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_BIND=0/1` | Alias-style opt-out for first-run packaged Codex app bind (see also `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_BIND_INSTALL`) |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_BIND_INSTALL=0/1` | Opt out/in of packaged Codex app bind self-heal on first durable CLI run or rotation enable |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_LAUNCHER_INSTALL=0/1` | Opt out/in of supported user-level launcher routing on first durable CLI run or rotation enable |
| `CODEX_TUI_V2=0/1` | Disable or enable TUI v2 |
| `CODEX_TUI_COLOR_PROFILE=truecolor|ansi256|ansi16` | Color profile selection |
| `CODEX_TUI_GLYPHS=ascii|unicode|auto` | Glyph mode selection |
| `CODEX_AUTH_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` | HTTP request timeout override |
| `CODEX_AUTH_STREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` | Stream stall timeout override |
| `CODEX_AUTH_MIN_ROTATION_INTERVAL_MS=<ms>` | Minimum time between global account switches (default `60000`). The proxy biases selection toward the last-served account within this window to reduce the rate at which different OAuth tokens appear from the same IP. Set to `0` to disable. |
| `CODEX_AUTH_SCHEDULING_STRATEGY=hybrid/sequential` | Account scheduling strategy (default `hybrid`). `sequential` (drain-first) keeps one active account until it is fully exhausted before advancing to the next; see [Sequential / drain-first scheduling](#sequential--drain-first-scheduling). |
| `CODEX_AUTH_TOKEN_INVALIDATION_COOLDOWN_MS=<ms>` | Cooldown applied to an account when the upstream or token-refresh endpoint explicitly revokes its OAuth token (default `300000`, 5 minutes). Raise this if accounts continue to be re-invalidated after re-login. |

## Runtime Rotation Proxy

`codexRuntimeRotationProxy` is enabled by default. When enabled through defaults, settings, `codex-multi-auth rotation enable`, or `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_RUNTIME_ROTATION_PROXY=1`, the `codex-multi-auth-codex` wrapper starts a localhost-only Responses proxy for forwarded official Codex sessions, including CLI request commands, `codex app-server`, and `codex app` launches through the wrapper. For non-interactive request commands and `codex app`, the wrapper writes a temporary shadow `CODEX_HOME/config.toml` that selects a custom provider named `codex-multi-auth-runtime-proxy`, launches the official Codex surface against that provider, and removes the shadow home after the owning process exits. Interactive TUI sessions, `resume`/`fork`, and `codex app-server` instead stay on the canonical `CODEX_HOME` and receive the same provider through `-c` overrides, which avoids reindexing session history on every launch and leaves the real `config.toml` untouched. Set `codexRuntimeRotationProxy=false`, run `codex-multi-auth rotation disable`, or set `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_RUNTIME_ROTATION_PROXY=0` to bypass the proxy.

A single forwarded run can be pinned to one account with `codex-multi-auth-codex --account <selector>` (or `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_ACCOUNT`). The pin is applied per-invocation by that run's own proxy instance, so it never touches the persisted `switch` pin and cannot leak across concurrent sessions. Because the proxy is required for the pin to take effect, `--account` fails hard when the proxy is disabled rather than silently using a rotated account. See [Force an account for one invocation](reference/commands.md#force-an-account-for-one-invocation).

The proxy preserves request bodies and streaming responses, replaces outbound auth headers with the selected managed account, and rotates to another account before response bytes are streamed when it sees rate limits, server errors, network failures, or refresh failures. It removes hop-by-hop headers, private account metadata headers, and stale decoded `content-encoding` from client responses. If every account is unavailable, the proxy returns a structured pool-exhaustion error that points to `codex-multi-auth rotation status`.

**Anti-abuse protection.** Rapidly switching OAuth tokens from the same IP can trigger OpenAI's anti-abuse detection and cause accounts to be invalidated in sequence. The proxy includes two mitigations:

- **Token-invalidation detection**: when the upstream or the token-refresh endpoint returns an explicit OAuth revocation message, the proxy returns the error directly to the client instead of rotating to the next account. The affected account receives a 5-minute cooldown (`tokenInvalidationCooldownMs`, default `300000`) instead of the generic 30-second auth-failure cooldown. Configure via `CODEX_AUTH_TOKEN_INVALIDATION_COOLDOWN_MS`.
- **Rotation-rate throttle**: the proxy biases account selection toward the last-served account for a configurable window (default 60 seconds, `minRotationIntervalMs`). Accounts that are rate-limited or cooling down are still rotated around. Configure via `CODEX_AUTH_MIN_ROTATION_INTERVAL_MS` or set to `0` to disable.

### Sequential / drain-first scheduling

`schedulingStrategy` controls how the proxy picks an account for each request:

- `hybrid` (default) spreads load across all available accounts using a weighted health/token/freshness score. Both accounts tend to consume quota at a similar pace.
- `sequential` (drain-first) routes every new request to one active account and only advances to the next available account once the current one is fully exhausted (rate-limited, cooling down, or circuit-open). Because the scan wraps the pool, an earlier account that has recovered its quota window is reclaimed as soon as the current account drains. This staggers quota recovery across accounts for longer uninterrupted sessions.

In `sequential` mode a manual pin (`codex-multi-auth switch <index>`) still takes precedence and is never overridden. Sequential mode intentionally ignores per-session affinity: once the active account changes, all subsequent requests follow the new active account regardless of which account originally handled a conversation. Enable it with `schedulingStrategy: "sequential"` in settings or `CODEX_AUTH_SCHEDULING_STRATEGY=sequential` for a per-process trial.

### Many parallel agents / high concurrency

When you drive many agents in parallel (for example a swarm of deep agents), each is usually a separate `codex-multi-auth-codex` process with its own in-process rotation state. Concentrated load on a small pool causes cascading `429`s. The relevant knobs:

- `pidOffsetEnabled` (default `true`, env `CODEX_AUTH_PID_OFFSET_ENABLED`): gives each process a small deterministic account-selection bias so separate processes prefer different accounts instead of all selecting the same one. This is the primary lever for the multi-process swarm case and is on by default; it is a no-op for single-account pools, and a manual pin plus health/quota scoring still take precedence over the small offset. Set `false` (or `CODEX_AUTH_PID_OFFSET_ENABLED=0`) to force every process to score accounts identically.
- `retryAllAccountsRateLimited` (default `false`), with `retryAllAccountsMaxRetries` (default `0`) and `retryAllAccountsMaxWaitMs` (default `0`): when every account is momentarily rate-limited, wait for the soonest quota window and retry instead of returning pool-exhaustion immediately. Keep the retry/wait budgets bounded so a blocking wait does not exceed the host client's own request timeout.
- `routingMutex` (default `legacy`, env `CODEX_AUTH_ROUTING_MUTEX`): set to `enabled` to serialize account selection *within a single process*. It has no effect across separate agent processes.

The structural fix is more accounts: with N accounts and M ≫ N concurrent agents, roughly `M/N` agents share each account, so rate-limit pressure only drops as N grows. See [High parallelism / swarms of agents](troubleshooting.md#high-parallelism--swarms-of-agents) for the full playbook, including the host-client-side `Provider response headers timed out after 10000ms` timeout (which this plugin cannot change).

Microsoft/Outlook SSO accounts may be more sensitive to proxy-mediated token use. If an Outlook-linked account is invalidated on every first request through the proxy but works normally on ChatGPT web, the root cause is likely IP or device binding on the Microsoft side. Raising `CODEX_AUTH_TOKEN_INVALIDATION_COOLDOWN_MS` and re-logging in the affected account typically resolves the cascade. If the problem persists, consider excluding the Microsoft account from the rotation pool via `codex-multi-auth switch`.

For `codex app` launches that go through the wrapper, the wrapper automatically starts a small internal helper so rotation can keep working if the desktop app launcher detaches. The helper stores only local runtime status, uses the same per-session proxy client key as the CLI path, and exits after an idle timeout.

`codex-multi-auth rotation enable` also binds the packaged desktop app to a persistent localhost router. This backs up the real Codex `config.toml`, writes the `codex-multi-auth-runtime-proxy` provider into the real Codex home, starts the router immediately, and installs a user login startup entry: a Startup `.cmd` on Windows or a LaunchAgent on macOS. The persistent provider is marked as not requiring OpenAI auth and uses a local app-bind client token, so the desktop runtime does not display the selected multi-auth account while codex-multi-auth status and quota views still read the router's last-account telemetry. `codex-multi-auth rotation disable` and `codex-multi-auth rotation unbind-app` stop that router, remove the startup entry, and restore the backed-up Codex config. The official app files are not patched.

Package install scripts stay side-effect-free (postinstall prints a short notice only). First-run self-heal of desktop defaults runs once on a durable global install when you invoke `codex-multi-auth ...`, and again as needed from `codex-multi-auth rotation enable`:

- The official CLI credential store is pinned to `cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"` in `~/.codex/config.toml`, so front-ends that exec the official binary directly stop triggering macOS login-keychain prompts. Set `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_ENFORCE_CLI_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0` to skip.
- Packaged Codex app bind is repaired when a Codex desktop app is detected. Set `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_BIND=0` or `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_BIND_INSTALL=0` to skip, or `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_BIND_INSTALL=1` to force it.
- Supported user-level launcher routing is installed for global installs. Set `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_LAUNCHER_INSTALL=0` to skip shortcut routing, or run `codex-multi-auth-app-launcher --remove` to restore backed-up Windows shortcuts or remove the managed macOS wrapper later.
- The one-time claim is recorded at `~/.codex/multi-auth/first-run-setup.json`. `npx` and project-local installs skip first-run setup so they do not consume the marker. An existing marker from before the auth-store step is migrated in place, replaying only that step — app bind and launcher install are not rerun.
- Installed wrappers may perform a best-effort daily npm version check during normal forwarded Codex startup. When npm has a newer release, the wrapper only prints a manual notice: `npm install -g codex-multi-auth@latest`. It never runs npm install or update commands for you. Notices are shown only on a TTY or when `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DEBUG=1`.

Some Windows installs expose Codex only as a packaged `shell:AppsFolder` app entry. Those entries cannot be retargeted like `.lnk` files, so the persistent app bind is the supported path for making the pinned packaged app use rotation automatically.

## Shipped Templates

The shipped config templates expose first-class current OpenAI model aliases:

- both `config/codex-modern.json` and `config/codex-legacy.json` include the GPT-5.6 tiers (`gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`), plus `gpt-5.5` and `gpt-5.5-pro`. The modern template collapses each tier's efforts into `variants`; the legacy template lists one entry per effort (for example `gpt-5.6-sol-high`) for Codex builds that predate the `variants` picker
- GPT-5.6 adds two reasoning tiers above `xhigh`: `max`, and `ultra` on Sol/Terra only. `ultra` selects Codex's automatic subagent delegation and is sent to the API as `max`, mirroring upstream Codex
- no GPT-5.6 tier accepts `none` or `minimal` reasoning effort; requests using them are coerced up to `low`
- `gpt-5.6` on its own resolves to Sol, the flagship tier; the legacy `gpt-5` alias still resolves to `gpt-5.5`
- `config/codex-modern.json` and `config/codex-legacy.json` expose current documented GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, and GPT-5.3 Codex model IDs
- deprecated Codex selectors such as `gpt-5-codex` and `gpt-5.1-codex*` are treated as compatibility aliases and retried on the current documented Codex model when the ChatGPT Codex surface rejects them
- the wrapper and optional plugin-host runtime try those models directly and only fall back to `gpt-5.4` after a real ChatGPT Codex unsupported-model response
