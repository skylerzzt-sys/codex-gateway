 * platform PID ceiling (`99999999`, `2_147_483_646`) and for "a second live
 * process" with `process.ppid`. Neither is a fact the test controls:
 * `process.kill` may raise `EINVAL` rather than `ESRCH` for an out-of-range
 * PID — which happens to classify as dead only because every liveness check in
 * this tree treats every errno but `EPERM` as dead — and `process.ppid` inside
 * a vitest worker is the pool process, whose identity and lifetime differ
 * between the `threads` and `forks` pools and which can exit mid-run (#668).
 *
 * Spawning a process and killing it makes "dead" a fact; keeping one alive for
 * the duration of a test makes "live" a fact.
