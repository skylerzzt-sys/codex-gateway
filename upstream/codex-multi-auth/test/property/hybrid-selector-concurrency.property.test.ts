/**
 * HI-05 concurrency coverage for `selectHybridAccount`.
 *
 * The companion `rotation-concurrency.property.test.ts` exercises the routing
 * mutex against a simulated cursor / cooldown map. That file documents the
 * critical-section invariants the rotation pipeline relies on, but it does
 * not call `selectHybridAccount` directly. This file fills that gap: it
 * spawns N parallel `selectHybridAccount` calls that each mutate the shared
 * `HealthScoreTracker` / `TokenBucketTracker` / per-account `isAvailable`
 * state inside the critical section, and asserts that under
 * `routingMutex === "enabled"` the selector never hands the same slot to two
 * concurrent callers when only one slot is available.
 *
 * Rationale:
 *   `selectHybridAccount` itself is pure w.r.t. its inputs, but real callers
 *   interleave selection with mutation of the trackers and the pool's
 *   `isAvailable` view (drain tokens, record rate-limit, flip availability).
 *   Without serialization, two concurrent callers can observe the same
 *   "last remaining available" slot and both pick it — the exact TOCTOU the
 *   routing mutex is meant to close.
