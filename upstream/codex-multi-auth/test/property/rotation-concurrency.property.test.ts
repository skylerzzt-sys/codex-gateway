 * Simulates N concurrent requests touching a shared `activeIndex` cursor and
 * an in-memory cooldown map to expose the TOCTOU race the routing mutex is
 * meant to close.
 *
 * Invariants under `"enabled"` mode:
 *   1. No lost updates: every attempted selection must either appear in the
 *      final history or be observed as superseded, never silently dropped.
 *   2. No double-selection inside a single cooldown window: if an account is
 *      marked cooling at time T, no concurrent selection may also mark the
 *      same account at time T without observing the cooldown.
 *   3. Cursor monotonicity w.r.t. the serialization order: reads observed
 *      inside the critical section are not stale.
 *
 * Under `"legacy"` mode the same scenarios may exhibit lost updates — those
 * runs are kept as a baseline to document the pre-PR-N behaviour.
