/**
 * Content-hash-keyed snapshot of on-disk storage metadata. The proxy is a
 * long-running process; the `switch`/`unpin`/`best` CLI runs in a different
 * process and mutates the storage file. We re-read only the top-level
 * `pinnedAccountIndex` and `affinityGeneration` fields on each request so
 * manual changes are honored without doing a full AccountManager reload
 * (which would lose in-memory cooldown state).
 *
 * We key the cache on a sha1 of the file bytes rather than `mtimeMs` because
 * Windows file systems can report sub-millisecond mtime granularity that is
 * coarser than our atomic-rename writes — two CLI bumps that happen close
 * together can land on the same `mtimeMs` and silently bypass an mtime-based
 * cache. The hashing cost is negligible for the small accounts.json file
 * (typically < 50KB) and keeps cache correctness independent of FS mtime
 * resolution. See #474.
 *
 * We additionally retain the last-seen `mtimeMs`/`size` so the hot path can
 * skip the `readFileSync` + sha1 entirely when neither has changed since the
 * previous read AND the cached mtime has settled past
 * `MTIME_SHORTCIRCUIT_SETTLE_MS` (the common case — the proxy reads on every
 * request but the file only mutates on a `switch`/`unpin`/`best` CLI
 * invocation, then sits quiescent). The sha1 remains the source of truth:
 * when `mtimeMs`/`size` differ, were never cached, or the mtime is too recent
 * to trust against same-tick writes, we re-read and hash, so the content-hash
 * path still protects against the coarse-mtime collision described above
 * whenever the file is re-read.
